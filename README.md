- 👋 Hi, I’m @sdreitlein
- 👀 I was a web designer back in the time before css and an early adopter. Front end experience was in coldfusion, VB, and C+ but years ago. I’m a project manager (CAPM). 
- 🌱 I’m currently getting up to speed in full stack web development to transition from user experience and marketing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects.
